â€‹Hello beautiful people!! This is my very first website that I've created through the "Girls Who Code" program. At the moment I've learned to create basic coding projects, such as "scratches" and to create more websites. I was contemplating what on earth I would be doing over this summer besides watch watching Netflix and eating ice cream, now I'm blessed to be here! In this website you'll get to know more about me and my coding experience, enjoy <3
